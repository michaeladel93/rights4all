Rights For All provides court document translation to assist with legal matters. Legal translations often have their own unique and highly technical language and our firm can provide reliable, skilled translators, both in the UK and overseas, to assist you with your legal document translation requirements. The linguists that we use within our firm have a minimum of five years' translation experience, translate solely into their mother tongue and are qualified and/or vastly experienced in the legal profession- we have even got solicitors and barristers on our books! It means we are able to translate even the most demanding legal document and match every job with a subject expert, so you can rely on experts, no matter what kind of evidence you have to translate.

       <h2 style="margin-top: 15px;color: RGB(114,69,50);font-weight: bold">What is legal translation?</h2>
       
       <p>Legal translation is a translation that has been formally verified for use in official purposes.
Documents that require certified translation services might include papers that have to be submitted to Ministry of Manpower and Immigration or Ministry of Justice (such as birth, marriage and divorce certificates), official transcripts (such as high school certificates, university degrees and vocational training certificates).
